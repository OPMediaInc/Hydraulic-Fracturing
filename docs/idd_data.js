Before you pull on water get with the line boss and make sure your prime up line is open. When it&rsquo;s confirmed to be open engage your suction pump pull on water fill your tub and let the line boss know that your ready and he will give you the signal to give boost or for you to send charge so you can prime up pumps, fill the iron with water to look for leaks before pressure testing. When you give boost let the line boss know your getting returns and he&rsquo;ll give the signal to the pump operator to prime up his pumps.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>To send charge engage your hydraulics and slowly throttle up your engine to desired amount of boost pressure depending on the blender operator or which type of blender is in line or what your company policy is.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>After the pump operator gets the desired rate through each pump he will let the blender operator and the line boss know that everything is primed up and in break and that he&rsquo;s ready for pressure test.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>After a successful pressure test the line boss will bleed off to 0&rsquo;s and will open up his pop off&rsquo;s close his burst disk and have the pump operator equalize to the well.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>When fracking begins make sure you and the pump operator are on the same page and he&rsquo;s not pumping water faster than you can pull water on.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>When pumping begins make sure you bring your tub up a couple of BBls above the pump rate and switch your tub to auto and it will keep Your tub level with the slurry rate.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Depending on your frac schedule, treater or company Man you will start fresh water or you will start on acid. When pumping acid begins you have 1 acid hose in line. 1 suction hose in line will give you about 10 barrels a min max if you go over that limit you will run the risk of losing prime and cavatating your pumps.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>While pumping acid your densitometer should be reading a 1.5 up to a 2.5 depending on how strong the acid is. Run the desired amount of acid that is calculated in your schedule. When the desired amount is reached the backside guys will let you know that they&rsquo;re opening you up to all your fresh lines and the flushing of the acid will begin.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>While pumping when it getting close to start pumping sand he treater will let the sand operator know when to fill your hopper.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Spin your sand screws to load them up and when the treater lets you know when to go he&rsquo;ll tell you to spin them and stage it.</li>\n</ul>","Content_Id":"ec44ea14-bc4e-4d6d-8a67-3aa5b1daba53","Content_Type":"Instruction"}],"Page_ID":"a16ab2b4-0f93-44d0-90ee-c0503cf65ec7","Page_Name":"Slurry Blender"}]
